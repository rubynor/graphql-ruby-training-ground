### Data leak - Example

Implementation with query leaking data

    query {
      companyLeak(id: "1") {
        id
        name
        transactionLogs {
          id
          companyId
          activityAt
        }
        accountants {
          id
          name
          transactionLogs {
            id
            companyId
            activityAt
          }
        }
      }
    }

response

    {
      "data": {
        "companyLeak": {
          "id": "1",
          "name": "AwesomeCo",
          "transactionLogs": [
            {
              "id": "1",
              "companyId": "1",
              "activityAt": "2019-10-12 14:44:21 UTC"
            }
          ],
          "accountants": [
            {
              "id": "1",
              "name": "Mr. Smith",
              "transactionLogs": [
                {
                  "id": "1",
                  "companyId": "1",
                  "activityAt": "2019-10-12 14:44:21 UTC"
                },
                {
                  "id": "2",
                  "companyId": "2",
                  "activityAt": "2019-10-11 14:44:21 UTC"
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    
THE LEAK. `"companyId": "2"`
 
Transaction log of company 2 shouldn't show in the item of company 1...

The problem is that it's not doing the db query with company_id = 1.
   
The same happens if you do `companies`, one company listed will show transaction_log of other company
